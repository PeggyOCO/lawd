- * @file
- * A module file for providing functionality to replace files on upload
- * Typical Drupal behavior is to rename files on upload to <filename>_0.<ext>
- * This module modifies that behavior.
- *
- * 1.0 - Behavior is as follows: when a user is replacing a file (remove and save).
- *   if the file to be removed is <filename>.<ext> and the file to be saved is
- *   <filename>_<[0-9]+>.<ext> then the file will be removed and the new file will
- *   be renamed to <filename>.<ext>
